# Assembly-3D


Assembly helps users organize 3D printing projects by tracking parts and their processes to minimize part failures.


As a part is uploaded, a serial number and a part number is attached at the same time as being attached to a project.
On the slicer page, the part is sliced using particular process in which its part number is updated.
Once on the print page, printer can be monitored. If part print is successful, project progress is updated. 
If not, failed feature is recorded and a troubleshooting sequence is started until solved.
